Headless is the future of Content Management:

Headless Content Management is the concept and name for taking web technology to the next plateu in system design and 
process architecture: it is converting the concept of content-management to a systemetized and scaled component in a more vast and complex network date architecture while assigning to it a more precise and deep requirement of performance and behavior. 

A content-management system need not make decisions on the display of it's content; only that the content is managed well and the interfaces are clean and pleasant and the content is up to date and presented efficiently. 

Complicating the content entry process by requiring redundant entry and complex interaction, mediation and oversight is inefficient. 

A proper content-management system should solve the problem of content management well. It should also ideally allow easy update of multiple entries quickly, provide fast and helpful categorization and caching of content and site actions, monitor and report application performance and site visitor behavior, log API calls and outgoing data requests. 

It is worth considering that some have been successful even in responding to asynchronous requests with customized preformatted blocks of templated markup. 

Traditional systems built to carefully route logic to views and map content to spots on pages is giving way to something more abstract and powerful. 

The Headless Content Managament System is just the name given a system built to consume and provide data without the idea of one single point of presentation.

It presents the guillotuine, as it were, to the traditional notion that we know what we are housing data for simply in response to the fact that 
more and more we aren't quite sure yet why we're storing data at all.
